# Azure-Route-Server
Azure Route Server High Availability Implementation & Troubleshooting

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Azure Route Server (ARS) to enable dynamic routing between Azure and on-premises networks via BGP, ensuring high availability and resilient hybrid connectivity in enterprise environments.

The primary use case involved configuring a redundant routing setup between Azure Virtual Network Gateways, SD-WAN appliances, and Azure Firewall while addressing route propagation issues, failover inconsistencies, and misconfigured BGP advertisements.

🎯 Objectives
Enable dynamic BGP route exchange between Azure and on-premises via Route Server

Integrate Azure Firewall with Route Server to support forced tunneling and traffic inspection

Ensure HA and resilience in routing paths during failover scenarios

Harden routing behavior and security posture

Document real-world troubleshooting for Azure Route Server deployments
